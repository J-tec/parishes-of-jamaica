    <h2>Westmoreland</h2>
    <p class="parish-info">
      Westmoreland is known for its lush landscapes and the popular tourist destination of Negril, which boasts stunning beaches and vibrant nightlife. Westmoreland has an area of 807 square kilometres (312 sq mi), making it Jamaica's eighth-largest parish. Westmoreland's population of 144,817 is made up of a large percentage of ethnic East Indians, descendants of indentured laborers who came to Jamaica from India to work after Britain abolished slavery in 1834 and the demand for labor remained high. Many intermarried with people of African descent, and their multi-racial descendants are known locally as "half indian". As a result of the fertile plains, the parish thrives on agriculture, mainly sugarcane, which offers direct employment. Negril is one of the main tourist destinations in Jamaica. Since the 1950s tourism has been the fastest-growing sector.
