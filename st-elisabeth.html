    <h2>St. Elisabeth</h2>
    <p class="parish-info">
      St. Elisabeth is known for its rich agricultural heritage and landmarks like the Black River and the Appleton Rum Estate. Its capital is Black River. The parish is located at latitude 18°15'N, and longitude 77°56'W; to the west of Manchester, to the east of Westmoreland, and to the south of St. James and Trelawny. It covers an area of 1,212.4 km2, making it Jamaica's second-largest parish, smaller only than Saint Ann's 1,212.6 km2. In the 19th century Irish, Spanish, Portuguese, Scottish, Germans, Chinese, and East Indians migrated to Saint Elizabeth. There are pockets of ethnic concentrations in the parish, including Mulatto and Creole, notably found in the southeast.
