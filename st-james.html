    <h2>St. James</h2>
    <p class="parish-info">
      St. James is a parish located on the north-west end of Jamaica. It is known for its beautiful beaches and tourism centers, with Montego Bay as its capital. The parish is bordered by Trelawny in the east, St. Elizabeth in the south and Hanover and Westmoreland in the west. It covers an area of 594.9 km2, making it one of the smallest parishes in Jamaica. Today, Saint James is one of the fastest growing parishes on the island with large credits going to Montego Bay, because it is seen as an alternative to the overpopulated Kingston and Saint Andrew Corporate Area.
