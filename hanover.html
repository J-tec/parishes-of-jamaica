    <h2>Hanover</h2>
    <p class="parish-info">
      Hanover is one of Jamaica's smaller parishes, but it's famous for its beautiful beaches and historical sites. Lucea, the capital, is known for its Georgian architecture. Hanover covers an area of 450 km2. The capital town, Lucea, is located at latitude 18°25'N, longitude 78°08'W. The highest point in the parish is the Dolphin's Head, which serves as a landmark for ships at sea. Although Hanover is not one of Jamaica's major tourist areas, a tourist resort is situated in the village of Hopewell about 24 km (15 mi) east of Lucea. This area has several large hotels, including Round Hill and Tryall (noted for its golf course).
