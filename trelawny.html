    <h2>Trelawny</h2>
    <p class="parish-info">
      Trelawny is known for its historic sites, sugar estates, and the birthplace of legendary Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt. Falmouth, the capital, is a major cruise ship destination. Trelawny is located at latitude 18°15'N, longitude 77°46'W. It has an area of 874 km2, making it the fifth largest parish on the island. The southern section of Trelawny is part of the Cockpit Country, and is uninhabitable. It is therefore a natural reserve for flora and fauna; most of Jamaica's 27 endemic bird species can be found there. Trelawny's sources of employment are based on agriculture, manufacturing, and tourism. Rum and sugar are Trelawny's principal products. Trelawny Parish is the birthplace of several track and field athletes: Usain Bolt, Veronica Campbell-Brown, Michael Frater, Lerone Clarke, Michael Greene, Sanya Richards, Ben Johnson and Warren Weir.
